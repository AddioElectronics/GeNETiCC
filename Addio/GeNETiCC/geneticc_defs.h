/*
*	Generic Pointer Cast
*
*	For casting non standard type pointers, so they are able to be passed to the generic macros.
*
*	*If you ever see the error "cast to union type from type not present in union,"
*	*you either passed a struct pointer or other value not included in "geneticc_union."
*	*If it was not a struct, you can add the value to the union(as long as it is under 64 bits),
*	*or simply cast to a value that is in the union(Which what this macro does).
*	*Unfortunately your IDE will not display the line which calls the macro, but the macro itself,
*	*which can be difficult to track down.
*
*	ex.
*
*	struct example* x;
*	struct example a[10];
*
*	Array_IndexOf(a, CAST_STRUCT x);
*	or
*	Array_IndexOf(a, (char*) x);
