# GeNETiCC Barebones ( C Library Submodule)
#### `V0.5.x`

__**Barebones version of GeNETiCC for library creation**__

Only contains all the macros, functions, structures and unions required for creating GeNETiCC macros/functions/types.
At the moment there are no tutorials or instructions on how to create a GeNETiCC library, your best bet is to look at the full version's branch, or the [CeriHAL repo](#https://github.com/AddioElectronics/CeriHAL), and try to decipher it. Its really not that complicated, just time consuming.
